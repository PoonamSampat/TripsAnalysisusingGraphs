# Trips Analysis using Graphs
Graph Analysis of the stations data, using Graph Frames in Spark

Have tried to explore Graph Concepts in Graph Analytics, using station and it's respective trips.
Used GraphFrames in Spark to answer basic questions regarding the data set.

Questions Answered:

1.Find out number of incoming connections and outgoing connections for each node and print the top 10 nodes.

2.Find out which are the most common direct routes that people take.

3.See which are the stations where people most frequently start their trips but do not come back.

4.Find all such patterns where any station a is connected to station b, b is connected to c, but c is not directly connected to a.

5.Figure out the most important station.

To run the code set up a Spark Infrastructure, the input files are - stations.csv & trips.csv , execute the IPython notebook.
